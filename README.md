Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms that can learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. One of the applications of machine learning is in predicting the market price of products, such as laptops.To build a machine learning model for laptop market price predictions, the first step is to collect a dataset of laptop prices along with their specifications and other relevant information such as release date, brand, etc. Once the data is collected, it needs to be cleaned and preprocessed by removing duplicates, filling in missing values, and removing irrelevant information.The next step is feature engineering, which involves creating new features based on the existing features that can help improve the accuracy of the model. For example, creating a feature that represents the age of the laptop since release date.After feature engineering, an appropriate machine learning model is selected for the problem at hand. Linear regression, decision trees, and random forests are some of the popular models for price predictions.The model is then trained using the cleaned dataset and the selected machine learning algorithm. Once the model is trained, its accuracy is validated using a validation dataset that the model has not seen before. The model is then tested on a test dataset to see how well it performs on new data.

Once the model has been validated and tested, it can be deployed to predict the prices of new laptops based on their specifications. It's important to note that the accuracy of the model depends on the quality and quantity of the data, the features selected, and the machine learning algorithm used.

### Implementation

We used TensorFlow, Keras as main framework for this and use normal python libraries like matplotlib, NumPy, pandas, sklearn to other purposes. They are an open-source machine learning library for Python, mainly developed by the Facebook AI Research team. These are the main steps we followed to build and train the models.

1. Import Libraries
2. Load Dataset into the Data Frame
3. Dataset Cleaning
4. Dataset Preprocessing
5. Analyze the Data
6. Prepare Dataset
7. Create Model
8. Instantiate Model
9. Instantiate Loss
10. Instantiate Optimizer
11. Training the Model
12. Prediction
